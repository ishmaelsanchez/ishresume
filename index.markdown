As a leader you determine the excellence and attitude of your team. My time in the Army exposed me to Leadership by Example and how important it is to be involved in all facets whether that's leading, talking, listening, working, observing, etc. When you lead by example, you set the standard and define the expectations of what's possible. Actions will always speak louder than words. When you do work and make things happen it inspires. Leading by example you create a positive environment and ultimately forge a path for others to see what's possible. By doing this you make it easy for others to follow you on your journey toward excellence. This me an nutshell, if this interests you <a title="Contact Ishmael" href="/contact/">contact me</a>.
