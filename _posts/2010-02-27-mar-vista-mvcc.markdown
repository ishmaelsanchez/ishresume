<p>I served as lead developer for the redesign of this website.
  I defined the Drupal architecture and created the custom sub-theme.</p>

<p>I developed the dynamic parts of the site and configure several modules based on the client's feature requests.
  This site was created while I was a web developer at Urban Insight.</p>
