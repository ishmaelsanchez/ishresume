<p>I created this site with Drupal and using a zen subtheme. I performed new feature implementation, Drupal module and security upgrades. Prior to moving their static website to use Drupal I managed the site using Dreamweaver.</p>
<p>This project was developed while I was employed by <a href="http://urbaninsight.com/" rel="nofollow">Urban Insight</a>. Additionally, I served as a project manager and lead developer for this project.</p>
